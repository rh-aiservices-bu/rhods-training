# Challenge 1 - Training from a Notebook

You are working for a credit card company and are one of the few people who work on fraud detection models in this company.
You just got an alarm, turns out the production model is experience some extreme model drift and it needs to be retrained asap!
Unfortunately, your colleague who is responsible for managing the models is out in the mountains today and won't be reachable.
Luckily, they have everything saved to git, so all you need to do is pull that and retrain the model.

From what you have learned, these are the steps you need to take:

- Create a new Data Science project to get access to a Notebook and name it "NotebookTraining-*your_name*"
- Clone this git repository: https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/rhods-training/tree/main/1_training_from_notebook 
- Run the model training notebook (train_model.ipynb)
- Run an inference to make sure that the model produces reasonable answers/accuracy (test_model.py)
- Clean up after yourself! - Remove the Data Science project, yes, we will check if you did this or not
